## Overview

AeroScan is an IoT-based system designed to monitor the Quality and Performance (Q&P) of wireless network infrastructure. This project utilizes Raspberry Pi devices deployed across a site to collect real-time network metrics. These metrics are then sent to a central server for aggregation by Prometheus and visualization via Grafana dashboards, providing valuable insights into network health, helping to identify potential issues, and ensuring a reliable wireless experience.

The system features a central registration service (`pi-registrar`) for dynamic discovery of Raspberry Pi nodes by Prometheus. Configuration of the Raspberry Pis, including sensitive details like WiFi credentials and API keys, can be managed remotely using Ansible from the central server.

## Features

*   **Distributed Monitoring:** Uses Raspberry Pi devices as network sensors.
*   **Centralized Data Collection & Visualization:** Employs Prometheus for metrics scraping/storage and Grafana for dashboards.
*   **Dynamic Pi Discovery:** A custom `pi-registrar` service allows Prometheus to dynamically find active Raspberry Pi nodes.
*   **Secure Communication:**
    *   Pis report to the registrar over HTTPS.
    *   Registrar uses an API key for authenticating Pi registration.
    *   Prometheus scrapes the registrar over HTTPS.
*   **Comprehensive Metrics Collection:**
    *   Network Latency (Ping RTT, TTL) & Jitter.
    *   Internet Bandwidth (Upload/Download via Speedtest).
    *   Connected WiFi AP Signal Strength & Link Quality (via `iwconfig`).
    *   Nearby Wireless Access Points Scan (SSID, BSSID, Channel, Signal Strength via `nmcli`).
    *   Device IP Addresses (for specified wireless and LAN interfaces).
*   **Remote Configuration (via Ansible):**
    *   Ability to update Pi configurations (WiFi credentials, API keys, script settings) from the central server using Ansible.
    *   Dynamic Ansible inventory sourced from the `pi-registrar` service.
*   **Unique Device Identification:** Each Raspberry Pi sensor uses a persistent unique identifier.
*   **GPIO Interaction (Optional):** Functionality to reset the device identifier using physical buttons.

## Architecture Overview

1.  **Raspberry Pi Node (`main.py`):**
    *   Pulls the latest version of `AeroScan/pi/software/main.py` from Git on boot.
    *   Reads local configuration files for registrar URL, API key, and RPi Connect device name.
    *   Periodically collects network metrics using system tools (`ping`, `speedtest-cli`, `iwconfig`, `nmcli`).
    *   Exposes these metrics via a Prometheus exporter endpoint (e.g., `http://<pi_ip>:8000/metrics`).
    *   Registers itself (identifier, IP, metrics port) with the central `pi-registrar` service over HTTPS using an API key.
2.  **Central Server:**
    *   **Pi-Registrar Service (Docker):**
        *   A Flask API listens for registrations from Pi nodes.
        *   Exposes an `/targets` endpoint for Prometheus HTTP Service Discovery (providing a list of active Pis).
        *   Exposes an `/ansible_inventory` endpoint (dynamic inventory source for Ansible).
        *   Serves traffic over HTTPS using self-signed certificates generated by `setup_server.sh`.
    *   **Prometheus (Docker):**
        *   Configured to use HTTP Service Discovery, querying the `pi-registrar`'s `/targets` endpoint to find Pis to scrape.
        *   Scrapes metrics from each registered Pi.
        *   Stores time-series data.
    *   **Grafana (Docker):**
        *   Connects to Prometheus as a data source.
        *   Provides dashboards for visualizing network metrics from all Pis.
    *   **Ansible (on Docker Host):**
        *   Uses a dynamic inventory script that queries the `pi-registrar`'s `/ansible_inventory` endpoint.
        *   Allows administrators to run playbooks to configure Pis (e.g., update WiFi, API keys, manage files).

## Setup and Installation

This project involves setting up a Central Server and one or more Raspberry Pi nodes.

### A. Central Server Setup (Ubuntu Recommended)

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   An Ubuntu server (or other Linux distribution capable of running Docker and Ansible).
    *   Docker and Docker Compose installed.
        ```bash
        # Example for Ubuntu:
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
        sudo systemctl start docker
        sudo systemctl enable docker
        sudo usermod -aG docker $USER # Add your user to docker group, then log out/in
        ```
    *   Ansible installed (see "C. Ansible for Configuration Management" section below or install directly).
    *   Git installed (`sudo apt install -y git`).
    *   OpenSSL installed (usually present, for certificate generation).

2.  **Clone AeroScan Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aero-Scan/AeroScan.git
    cd AeroScan
    ```

3.  **Run Server Setup Script:**
    This script generates SSL certificates for `pi-registrar` and an `.env` file with the API key for Pi registration.
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup_server.sh
    ./setup_server.sh
    ```
    *   Follow the prompts (e.g., for Server IP to embed in the certificate's Subject Alternative Name).
    *   Note the `PI_REGISTER_API_KEY` generated – you'll need this for the Raspberry Pis.
    *   This will create/populate:
        *   `Docker/config/certs/` (pi-registrar's cert and key)
        *   `Docker/config/prometheus_certs/` (copy of pi-registrar's public cert for Prometheus)
        *   `ansible/config/` (copy of pi-registrar's public cert for Ansible inventory script)
        *   `Docker/.env` (with `PI_REGISTER_API_KEY`)

4.  **Start Docker Services:**
    Navigate to the Docker directory and start the services:
    ```bash
    cd Docker/
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    *   Verify services are running: `docker-compose ps`
    *   Check logs if needed: `docker-compose logs pi-registrar`, `docker-compose logs prometheus`.

5.  **Configure Grafana:**
    *   Access Grafana at `http://<your_server_ip>:3000` (default admin/admin, change password).
    *   Add Prometheus as a data source:
        *   URL: `http://prometheus:9090` (uses Docker's internal DNS).
        *   Click "Save & Test".
    *   Create or import dashboards to visualize AeroScan metrics.

### B. Raspberry Pi Node Setup

This assumes you have a custom Raspberry Pi OS image that:
*   Is based on a Debian-derived system (like Raspberry Pi OS).
*   Has networking configured to connect to your network (e.g., Ethernet or initial WiFi).
*   Has `git` installed.
*   On boot, automatically clones/pulls the AeroScan repository (e.g., into `~/AeroScan`) and runs `~/AeroScan/pi/software/main.py`.
*   The user running `main.py` (e.g., `pi` or `aeroscan`) has necessary permissions.

**1. Required Packages on the Raspberry Pi Image:**
Ensure these are installed (can be part of your image build process or installed manually once):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip git network-manager wireless-tools iproute2
# For main.py Python dependencies:
sudo pip3 install prometheus-client speedtest-cli RPi.GPIO requests urllib3
```
*   **NetworkManager is crucial** if `main.py` uses `nmcli` for WiFi scanning and you plan to manage WiFi with Ansible via `nmcli`. Ensure it's the active network management service (this might involve disabling `dhcpcd`).

**2. Configuration Files on Each Raspberry Pi:**
These files need to be created in `/var/local/` on each Pi. This can be done manually for initial setup, or ideally, managed by Ansible.

*   **(Required) Registrar URL Configuration:**
    *   File: `/var/local/network_monitor_registrar_url.txt`
    *   Content: The HTTPS URL of your `pi-registrar` service.
        ```
        https://<YOUR_CENTRAL_SERVER_IP_OR_DNS>:5001/register
        ```
        (Replace `<YOUR_CENTRAL_SERVER_IP_OR_DNS>` with the IP/hostname you configured in the certificate SAN during `setup_server.sh`).

*   **(Required) API Key for Registration:**
    *   File: `/var/local/network_monitor_api_key.txt`
    *   Content: The exact `PI_REGISTER_API_KEY` generated by `setup_server.sh` (from `Docker/.env` on the server).
        ```
        your_generated_api_key_from_server
        ```

*   **(Required for HTTPS) Server Certificate:**
    *   Copy the public certificate of your `pi-registrar` service from the server to the Pi.
    *   Source on server: `AeroScan/Docker/config/certs/cert.pem`
    *   Destination on Pi: `/etc/ssl/certs/pi_registrar_server.pem` (this path is referenced in `main.py`).
    *   **Manual Copy Example (run from server):**
        ```bash
        scp ~/AeroScan/Docker/config/certs/cert.pem <pi_user>@<pi_ip>:/tmp/cert.pem
        ```
    *   **Then on the Pi:**
        ```bash
        sudo mv /tmp/cert.pem /etc/ssl/certs/pi_registrar_server.pem
        sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl/certs/pi_registrar_server.pem
        sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/pi_registrar_server.pem
        ```
        (This step is a prime candidate for automation with Ansible later).

*   **(Optional) RPi Connect Device Name (if using that Grafana link feature):**
    *   File: `/var/local/rpi_connect_device_name.txt`
    *   Content: The name you assigned this Pi in your `connect.raspberrypi.com` dashboard.
        ```
        MyLivingRoomPi
        ```

**3. `main.py` Execution:**
Your image's boot process should:
1.  Navigate to the cloned `AeroScan/pi/software/` directory.
2.  Execute `python3 main.py`.
It's highly recommended to run `main.py` as a systemd service for reliability and auto-restarts. Create a file like `/etc/systemd/system/aeroscan.service`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=AeroScan Network Monitor
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target git-pull-aeroscan.service # Example: ensure network is up and git pull (if separate service) ran

[Service]
User=aeroscan # Or 'pi', the user running the script
Group=aeroscan # Or 'pi'
WorkingDirectory=/home/aeroscan/AeroScan/pi/software # Adjust to your clone path
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/aeroscan/AeroScan/pi/software/main.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
# Optional: StandardOutput=journal, StandardError=journal for logging

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Then enable and start it: `sudo systemctl enable aeroscan.service && sudo systemctl start aeroscan.service`. (You might need a separate service/script for the `git pull` part if it's complex or needs to happen before this service starts).

### C. Ansible for Configuration Management (Setup on Central Server)

1.  **Install Ansible (if not already done during server prerequisites):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ansible
    ```

2.  **Prepare SSH Key-Based Access to Pis:**
    *   On your central server (`it06`), ensure you have an SSH key pair (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`). If not, run `ssh-keygen`.
    *   Copy the server's public key to each Raspberry Pi for the user Ansible will connect as (e.g., `aeroscan`):
        ```bash
        # On server:
        ssh-copy-id aeroscan@<pi_ip_or_hostname>
        ```

3.  **Dynamic Inventory Script (`AeroScan/ansible/inventory_from_registrar.py`):**
    *   This script is included in the repository.
    *   Ensure it's executable: `chmod +x ~/AeroScan/ansible/inventory_from_registrar.py`.
    *   It expects the `pi-registrar`'s public certificate at `~/AeroScan/ansible/config/pi_registrar_server.pem` (this is copied by `setup_server.sh`).
    *   It uses `https://AeroScan:5001/targets` by default. Ensure `AeroScan` resolves to your server's IP on the Ansible control node (e.g., add `<your_server_ip> AeroScan` to `/etc/hosts` on the control node if not a public DNS name).

4.  **Ansible Configuration (`AeroScan/ansible/ansible.cfg`):**
    This file should be present in `AeroScan/ansible/` and point to your dynamic inventory:
    ```ini
    [defaults]
    inventory         = ./inventory_from_registrar.py
    host_key_checking = False ; For trusted local networks; set to True for stricter security.
    deprecation_warnings = False

    [privilege_escalation]
    become            = True
    become_method     = sudo
    # become_ask_pass = False ; Assumes passwordless sudo is configured on Pis for the ansible_user
    ```

5.  **Passwordless Sudo on Pis for Ansible User:**
    For Ansible to manage system settings (like `nmcli` for WiFi), the user it connects as (e.g., `aeroscan`) needs passwordless `sudo` rights on the Pis for specific commands. Edit `/etc/sudoers` on each Pi using `sudo visudo`:
    *   Example for user `aeroscan` needing `nmcli` and `systemctl`:
        `aeroscan ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nmcli, /bin/systemctl`
    *   Or for all commands (less secure):
        `aeroscan ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`

6.  **Run Ansible Playbooks:**
    Navigate to `AeroScan/ansible/` and run playbooks:
    ```bash
    cd ~/AeroScan/ansible/
    ansible-playbook playbooks/your_playbook_name.yml
    ```
    (Start with `playbooks/test_create_file.yml` to confirm setup).

## Usage

*   **Central Server:** The Docker services (Prometheus, Grafana, pi-registrar) run continuously.
*   **Raspberry Pi Nodes:** The `main.py` script collects and exposes metrics. It registers with `pi-registrar`.
*   **Monitoring:** Access Grafana at `http://<your_server_ip>:3000` to view dashboards.
*   **Configuration:** Use Ansible playbooks from the central server to manage Pis.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   Check `docker-compose logs <service_name>` on the server.
    *   Check `main.py` output or systemd service logs (`journalctl -u aeroscan.service` if set up) on the Pis.
    *   Use Ansible ad-hoc commands or playbooks for diagnostics.
